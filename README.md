# Dominos-Israel-Automated-Delivery
A project that automate the process of buying pizza from Dominos Israel

# The RAR file has the full project, and the Domi.py has the currect code (Ver. 0.5 beta/24.6.18)

A few notes:

I'm in now way, shape or form affiliated with Dominos Pizza Israel.

I'm also not responsible for any damage done with this program.

This program was build for education purposes. It is not an 'hacking' program.

The program goes all the way up until the payment part. Going after that part is illegal.

This is a 0.5 beta version of this program. It's going to get patched and fixed a lot in the next few weeks.

The config.json file might be problematic. If so, just delete and remake it.


And most importantly - any help with the code and every comment and would be appreciated!
